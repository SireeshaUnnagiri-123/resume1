              <h3>Marine Environment</h3>
      <p>I have recently completed an experimental project which is useful to overcome the problems faced in marine enviranment like occuring of poisonous gases,testing of hydrogen ions cocentration,with the sensors and other using IOT , salt pecentage in the oceans and to measure the PH level of water ranging from 7.5 t08.4 and its temparature varies depending upon the location,with warmer water nears the equator and colder water closes to the poles and marine water is also rich in various minerals such as magnesium,calcium,potassium and sulfate.and it supports thevast array of marme life from microscopic plankton to the largest mammals like whales. The movement of marine water is influenced by ocean currents,tides and winds,which play a crucial role in regulating the earths climate.Because water found in earths ocean and seas it covers about71 % of earth surface.</p>
